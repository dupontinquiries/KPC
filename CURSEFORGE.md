## What is KPC?

#### About KPC

At its core, KPC adds parkour and combat items to the game that enhance PvP and PvE.  However, it does much more than that... each game version has its own unique features that you can read about below.

#### 1.16.4

__KPC__ for Minecraft 1.16.4 aims to make the items found in the popular 1.12 version feel like vanilla items.  Many of the items have been redesigned to have __custom sounds, animations, etc,__ and a lot of the __balancing has been reworked.__

## Installation

This mod is __made for specific versions of Minecraft!__  It will not run on unsupported versions of the game.  To install the mod, simply put the mod jar file in your Minecraft mods folder ([How to install a Minecraft mod](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Installing_Forge_mods)).

## Versions

KPC currently runs on four different versions of Minecraft: __1.7.10, 1.12.2, 1.15.2, & 1.16.4.__  1.16.4 is the only supported versions at this time, but the 1.12.2 version is a great alternative as it was very popular among my mod testers.  __More versions will be listed if/when they become supported.__
